# Installation Guide for Setting Up an Ubuntu Machine for Quantitative Marketing & Economics Research

These pages document what I need to do when setting up a new Ubuntu machine for my research workflow.

I most recently did this for `Ubuntu 19.10` in December 2019.


!!! summary
    * If everything goes smoothly, you should be able to complete the installation in one sitting which should take about 2-3 hours.
    * Follow the steps one-by-one in the order they appear on the side bar and do not deviate from them, unless you really know what you are doing.
    * If you find any outdated links or unclear descriptions, feel free to [contact me](/contact/).
    * As much as possible, I've tried to do everything from the terminal so its easy to replicate.
